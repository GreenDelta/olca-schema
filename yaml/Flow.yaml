  name: Flow
  superClass: CategorizedEntity
  example: flow.jsonld
  doc: >
       Everything that can be an input or output of a process (e.g. a substance,
       a product, a waste, a service etc.)

  properties:
    - name: flowType
      type: FlowType
      doc: >
           The type of the flow. Note that this type is more a descriptor of
           how the flow is handled in calculations.

    - name: cas
      type: string
      doc: A CAS number of the flow.

    - name: formula
      type: string
      doc: A chemical formula of the flow.

    - name: flowPropertyFactors
      type: List[FlowPropertyFactor]
      doc: >
           Conversion factors between flow properties that can be used to
           express amounts of the flow.

    - name: location
      type: Location
      doc: >
           The location of the flow. Normally the location of a flow is defined
           by the process location where the flow is an input or output. However,
           some data formats define a location as a property of a flow.

    - name: referenceFlowProperty
      type: FlowProperty
      doc: >
           The flow property that should be normally used to express quantities
           of the flow (e.g. in results).
