class:
  name: Flow
  superClass: CategorizedEntity
  example: flow.json
  doc: >
       Everything that can be an input or output of a process (e.g. a substance,
       a product, a waste, a service etc.)

  properties:
    - name: flowType
      type: FlowType
      doc: >
           The type of the flow. Note that this type is more a descriptor of
           how the flow is handled in calculations.

    - name: cas
      type: string
      doc: A CAS number of the flow.

    - name: formula
      type: string
      doc: A chemical formula of the flow.

    - name: flowProperties
      type: List[FlowPropertyFactor]
      doc: >
           The flow properties (quantities) in which amounts of the flow can
           be expressed together with conversion factors between these flow
           flow properties.

    - name: location
      type: Ref[Location]
      doc: >
           The location of the flow. Normally the location of a flow is defined
           by the process location where the flow is an input or output. However,
           some data formats define a location as a property of a flow.
    
    - name: synonyms
      type: string
      doc: >
           A list of synonyms but packed into a single field. Best is to use
           semicolons as separator as commas are sometimes used in names of
           chemicals.
    
    - name: infrastructureFlow
      type: boolean
      doc: >
           Indicates whether this flow describes an infrastructure product. This
           field is part of the openLCA schema because of backward compatibility
           with EcoSpold 1. It does not really have a meaning in openLCA and
           should not be used anymore.
