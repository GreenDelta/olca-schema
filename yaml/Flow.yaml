       Everything that can be an input or output of a process (e.g. a substance,
       a product, a waste, a service etc.)

  properties:
    - name: flowType
      type: FlowType
      doc: >
           The type of the flow. Note that this type is more a descriptor of
           how the flow is handled in calculations.

      doc: A CAS number of the flow.

    - name: formula

    - name: flowProperties
      type: List[FlowPropertyFactor]
      doc: >
           The flow properties (quantities) in which amounts of the flow can
           be expressed together with conversion factors between these flow
           flow properties.

    - name: location
      type: Location
      doc: >
           The location of the flow. Normally the location of a flow is defined
           by the process location where the flow is an input or output. However,
           some data formats define a location as a property of a flow.
