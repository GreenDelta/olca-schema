  doc: >
       Indicates how default providers of product inputs or waste outputs in
       processes should be considered in the linking of a product system.

      doc: >
           Default provider settings are ignored in the linking process. This
           means that the linker can also select another provider even when a
           default provider is set.

    - name: PREFER_DEFAULTS
      index: 2
      doc: >
           When a default provider is set for a product input or waste output
           the linker will always select this process. For other exchanges it
           will select the provider according to its other rules.

    - name: ONLY_DEFAULTS
      index: 3
      doc: >
           Means that links should be created only for product inputs or waste
           outputs where a default provider is defined which are then linked
           exactly to this provider.
