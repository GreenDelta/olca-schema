       A `Ref` is a reference to some entity. When serializing an entity (e.g.
       a `Process`) that references another standalone entity (e.g. a `Flow` in
       an `Exchange`) we do not want to write the complete referenced entity
       into the serialized JSON object but just a reference. However, the
       reference contains some meta-data like name, category path etc. that are
       useful to display.

  properties:
    - name: category
      index: 5
      type: string
      doc: >
           The category path of the referenced entity, e.g.
           `Elementary flows/Emissions to air/unspecified`.

    - name: library
      index: 6
      type: string
      doc: >
           If the entity that is described by this reference is part of a
           library, this field contains the identifier of that library. The
           identifier is typically just the combination of the library name and
           version.

    - name: refUnit
      index: 7
      type: string
      doc: >
           This field is valid for references to entities which can have a
           (reference) unit, like flows, impact categories, or flow properties.

    - name: location
      index: 8
      type: string
      doc: >
           This field is only valid for references of processes or flows and
           contains the location name or code of that respective process or
           flow.

    - name: flowType
      index: 9
      type: FlowType
      doc: >
           In case of a reference to a flow, this field can contain the type of
           flow that is referenced.

    - name: processType
      index: 10
      type: ProcessType
      doc: >
           In case of a reference to a process, this fiel can contain the type
           of process that is referenced.
