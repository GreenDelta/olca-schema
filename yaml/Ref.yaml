       A Ref is a reference to a [RootEntity]. When serializing an entity (e.g.
       a [Process]) that references another standalone entity (e.g. a [Flow] in
       an [Exchange]) we do not want to write the complete referenced entity
       into the serialized JSON object but just a reference. However, the
       reference contains some meta-data like name, category path etc. that are
       useful to display.

  properties:
    - name: categoryPath
      type: List[string]
      doc: >
           The full path of the category of the referenced entity from top to
           bottom, e.g. `"Elementary flows", "Emissions to air", "unspecified"`.
    
    - name: library
      type: string
      doc: >
           If the entity that is described by this reference is part of a
           library, this field contains the identifier of that library. The
           identifier is typically just the combination of the library name and
           version.

    - name: refUnit
      type: string
      doc: >
           This field is only valid for references of flows or impact categories
           and contains the name (symbol) of the reference unit of that

    - name: location
      type: string
      doc: >
           This field is only valid for references of processes or flows and
           contains the location name or code of that respective process or
           flow.

    - name: flowType
      type: FlowType
      doc: >
           In case of a reference to a flow, this field can contain the type of
           flow that is referenced.
    
    - name: processType
      type: ProcessType
      doc: >

           of process that is referenced.
