       A Ref is a reference to a [RootEntity]. When serializing an entity
       (e.g. a [Process]) that references another standalone entity (e.g.
       a [Flow] in an [Exchange]) we do not want to write the complete
       referenced entity into the serialized JSON object but just a reference.
       However, the reference contains some meta-data like name, category path
       etc. that are useful to display.

  properties:
    - name: categoryPath
      type: List[string]
      doc: >
           The full path of the category of the referenced entity from top to
           bottom, e.g. `["Elementary flows", "Emissions to air", "unspecified"]`.
