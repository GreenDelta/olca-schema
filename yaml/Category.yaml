       A category is used for the categorisation of types like processes, flows,
       etc. The tricky thing is that the `Category` class inherits also from
       the [CategorizedEntity] type so that a category can have a category
       attribute which is then the parent category of this category (uff).

  properties:
    - name: modelType
      type: ModelType
      doc: The type of models that can be linked to the category.
