       A `RefEntity` is an entity that can be identified by a reference ID (or
       UUID). In most cases this is a stand-alone entity (`RootEntity`) but
       there are also entities (e.g. `Unit`, `NwSet`) that need a unique ID,
       e.g. for reference data lists or mapping files.

  properties:
