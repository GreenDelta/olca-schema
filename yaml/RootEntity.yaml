  name: RootEntity
  superClass: RefEntity
  doc: A `RootEntity` is a stand-alone data set (like a `Flow` or `Process`).

  properties:
    - name: category
      index: 5
      type: string
      doc: >
           A full path of the category. Forward slashes are used to separate the
           segments of this path, e.g.
           `Elementary flows/emissions/air/unspecified`.

    - name: lastChange
      index: 6
      type: dateTime
      doc: The timestamp when the entity was changed the last time.

    - name: tags
      type: List[string]
      index: 7
      doc: >
           A list of optional tags. A tag is just a string which should not
           contain commas (and other special characters).

    - name: version
      index: 8
      type: string
      doc: >
           A version number in MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format where the MINOR and
           PATCH fields are optional and the fields may have leading zeros
           (so 01.00.00 is the same as 1.0.0 or 1).

    - name: library
      index: 9
      type: string
      doc: >
           An identifier of a data library. This field should be only used in
           service APIs (like IPC, REST, gRPC, etc.) and of course only, if the
           respective dataset is part of a library. For datasets in data
           packages, the location of the package defines if the datasets are
           part of which library. It has then practical reasons to not tag all
           datasets with the library, e.g. renaming a library would require to
           change all datasets otherwise.
