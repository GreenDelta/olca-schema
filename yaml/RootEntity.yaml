  doc: A `RootEntity` is a stand-alone data set (like a `Flow` or `Process`).

  properties:
    - name: category
      index: 5
      type: string
      doc: >
           A full path of the category. Forward slashes are used to separate the
           segments of this path, e.g.
           `Elementary flows/emissions/air/unspecified`.

    - name: lastChange
      index: 6
      type: dateTime
      doc: The timestamp when the entity was changed the last time.

    - name: tags
      type: List[string]
      index: 7
      doc: >
           A list of optional tags. A tag is just a string which should not
           contain commas (and other special characters).

    - name: version
      index: 8
      type: string
      doc: >
           A version number in MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format where the MINOR and
           PATCH fields are optional and the fields may have leading zeros
           (so 01.00.00 is the same as 1.0.0 or 1).
