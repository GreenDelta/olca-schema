       Describes a the source or target flow of a flow mapping in a `FlowMap`.
       Such a flow reference can also optionally specify the unit and flow
       property (quantity) for which the mapping is valid. If the unit and
       quantity are not given, the mapping is based on the reference unit of the
       reference flow property of the respective flow.
  
  properties:
    - name: flow
      type: Ref[Flow]
      doc: The reference to the flow data set.
    
    - name: flowProperty
      type: Ref[FlowProperty]
      doc: >
           An optional reference to a flow property of the flow for which the
           mapping is valid.
    
    - name: unit
      type: Ref[Unit]
      doc: >
           An optional reference to a unit of the flow for which the mapping is
           valid
    
    - name: provider
      type: Ref[Process]
      doc: >
           In case of a product or waste flow a flow mapping can contain a
           provider which is the process that produces the product or a waste
           treatment process that consumes the waste flow. This is useful when
           we want to apply mappings of product and waste flows on databases and
           link them in the corresponding processes and product systems.
