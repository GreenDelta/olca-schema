  properties:
    - name: allocation
      index: 2
      type: AllocationType
      doc: The calculation type to be used in the calculation.

    - name: amount
      index: 3
      required: true
      type: double
      doc: >
           The amount of the reference flow of the calculation target for which
           the result should be calculated.

    - name: calculationType
      index: 4
      type: CalculationType
      doc: The type of calculation that should be performed.

    - name: flowProperty
      index: 5
      type: Ref[FlowProperty]
      doc: >
           The flow property of the amount of the reference flow for which a
           result should be calculated. If no flow property is provided it
           defaults to the reference flow property of the respective flow.

    - name: numberOfRuns
      index: 7
      type: integer
      doc: >
           This field is only valid when this setup describes a Monte Carlo
           simulation and contains the number of simulation runs in that case.

      type: Ref[NwSet]
      doc: The normalisation and weighting set for the calculation.

    - name: parameters
      index: 9
      type: List[ParameterRedef]
      doc: >
           A list of parameter redefinitions that should be used in the
           calculation.

    - name: target
      index: 10
      required: true
      type: Ref
      doc: >
           The product system or process that should be calculated. Note that
           a result is calculated for the reference flow of that calculation
           target (i.e. the reference flow of the product system or process).

    - name: unit
      index: 11
      type: Ref[Unit]
      doc: >
           The unit of the amount of the reference flow for which a result
           should be calculated. If no unit is provided it defaults to the
           reference unit of the respective flow.

    - name: withCosts
      index: 12
      type: boolean
      doc: >
           Indicates whether life cycle costs should be also calculated.

    - name: withRegionalization
      index: 13
      type: boolean
      doc: >
           Indicates whether a regionalized result should be calculated or
           not.
