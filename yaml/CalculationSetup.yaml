  properties:
    - name: calculationType
      type: CalculationType
      doc: The type of calculation that should be performed.

    - name: productSystem
      type: Ref[ProductSystem]
      doc: The product system that should be calculated (required).
    
    - name: impactMethod
      type: Ref[ImpactMethod]
      doc: The LCIA method for the calculation (optional).
    
    - name: withCosts
      type: boolean
      doc: >
          Indicates whether life cycle costs should be also calculated
          (optional).
    
    - name: withRegionalization
      type: boolean
      doc: >
           Indicates whether a regionalized result should be calculated or not.
           If this is set to true, the intervention matrix is indexed by
           (elementary flow, location) - pairs instead of just elementary flows.
           The LCI result then contains results for these pairs which can be
           then used in regionalized impact assessments.
