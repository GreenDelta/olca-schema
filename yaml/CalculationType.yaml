       An enumeration of the different calculation methods supported by openLCA.

  items:
    - name: SIMPLE_CALCULATION
      index: 1
      doc: >
           Calculates the total results for elementary flows, LCIA indicators,
           costs, etc. of a product system.

    - name: CONTRIBUTION_ANALYSIS
      index: 2
      doc: >
           Includes the total result vectors of a simple calculation but
           calculates also the direct contributions of each process (or better
           process product in case of multi-output processes) to these total
           results.

    - name: UPSTREAM_ANALYSIS
      index: 3
      doc: >
           Extends the contribution analysis by providing also the upstream
           results of each process (process product) in the product system. The
           upstream result contains the direct contributions of the respective
           process but also the result of the supply chain up to this process
           scaled to the demand of the process in the product system.

    - name: MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION
      index: 4
      doc: >
           A Monte Carlo simulation generates for each run, of a given number of
           a given number of iterations, random values according to the
           uncertainty distributions of process inputs/outputs, parameters,
           characterization factors, etc. of a product system and then performs
           a simple calculation for that specific run.
