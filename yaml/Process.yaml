      doc: >
           This field holds the last internal ID that was used in an exchange
           (which may have been deleted, so it can be larger than the largest
           internal ID of the exchanges of the process.) The internal ID of an
           exchange is used to identify exchanges within a process (for updates,
           data exchanges (see process links), etc.). When you add an exchange
           to a process, you should increment this field in the process and set
           the resulting value as the internal ID of that exchange. The sequence
           of internal IDs should start with `1`.

      type: string
      doc: >
           A data quality entry like `(1;3;2;5;1)`. The entry is a vector of
           data quality values that need to match the overall data quality
           system of the process (the system that is stored in the `dqSystem`
           property). In such a system the data quality indicators have fixed
           positions and the respective values in the `dqEntry` vector map to
           these positions.

           This field is part of the openLCA schema because of backward
           compatibility with EcoSpold 1. It does not really have a meaning in
           openLCA and should not be used anymore.
