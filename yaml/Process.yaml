    - name: dqEntry
      type: string
      doc: >
           A data quality entry like `(1;3;2;5;1)`. The entry is a vector of
           data quality values that need to match the overall data quality
           system of the process (the system that is stored in the `dqSystem`
           property). In such a system the data quality indicators have fixed
           positions and the respective values in the `dqEntry` vector map to
           these positions.

           This field is part of the openLCA schema because of backward
           compatibility with EcoSpold 1. It does not really have a meaning in
           openLCA and should not be used anymore.
