       A `FlowPropertyFactor` is a conversion factor between flow properties
       (quantities; `FlowProperty`) of a flow (`Flow`). As an example the amount
       of the flow 'water' in a process could be expressed in 'kg' mass or 'm3'
       volume. In this case the flow water would have two flow property factors:
       one for the flow property 'mass' and one for 'volume'. Each of these flow
       properties has a reference to a unit group (`UnitGroup`) which again has
       a reference unit. In the example the flow property 'mass' could reference
       the unit group 'units of mass' with 'kg' as reference unit and volume
       could reference the unit group 'units of volume' with 'm3' as reference
       unit. The flow property factor is now the conversion factor between these
       two reference units where the factor of the reference flow property of
       the flow is 1. If the reference flow property of 'water' in the example
       would be 'mass' the respective flow property factor would be 1 and the
       factor for 'volume' would be 0.001 (as 1 kg water is 0.001 m3). The
       amount of water in a process can now be also given in liter, tons, grams
       etc. For this, the unit conversion factor of the respective unit group
       can be used to convert into the reference unit (which then can be used to
       convert to the reference unit of another flow property). Another thing to
       note is that different flow properties can refer to the same unit group
       (e.g. MJ upper calorific value and MJ lower calorific value.)

           Indicates whether the flow property of the factor is the reference
           flow property of the flow. The reference flow property must have
           a conversion factor of 1.0 and there should be only one reference
           flow property.
