       A FlowPropertyFactor is a conversion factor between
       <a href="./FlowProperty.html">flow properties (quantities)</a>
       of a <a href="./Flow.html">flow</a>. As an example the amount of the
       flow 'water' in a process could be expressed in 'kg' mass or 'm3' volume.
       In this case the flow water would have two flow property factors: one for
       the flow property 'mass' and one for 'volume'. Each of these flow
       properties has a reference to a <a href="./UnitGroup.html">unit group</a>
       which again has a reference unit. In the example the flow property 'mass'
       could reference the unit group 'units of mass' with 'kg' as reference
       unit and volume could reference the unit group 'units of volume' with
       'm3' as reference unit. The flow property factor is now the conversion
       factor between these two reference units where the factor of the
       reference flow property of the flow is 1. If the reference flow property
       of 'water' in the example would be 'mass' the respective flow property
       factor would be 1 and the factor for 'volume' would be 0.001 (as 1 kg
       water is 0.001 m3). The amount of water in a process can now be also given
       in liter, tons, grams etc. For this, the unit conversion factor of the
       respective unit group can be used to convert into the reference unit
       (which then can be used to convert to the reference unit of another
       flow property). Another thing to note is that different flow properties
       can refer to the same unit group (e.g. MJ upper calorific value and MJ
       lower calorific value.)

           Indicates whether the flow property of the factor is the reference
           flow property of the flow. The reference flow property must have
           a conversion factor of 1.0 and there should be only one reference
           flow property.
