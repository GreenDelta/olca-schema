  name: ParameterScope
  doc: > 
      The possible scopes of parameters. Parameters can be defined globally, in
      processes, or impact categories. They can be redefined in calculation
      setups on the project and product system level, but the initial definition
      is always only global, in a process, or an LCIA category.
