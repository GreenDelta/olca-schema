           Indicates whether the unit is the reference unit of the unit group to
           which this unit belongs. If it is the reference unit the conversion
           factor must be 1.0. There should be always only one reference unit
           in a unit group. The reference unit is used to convert amounts given
           in one unit to amounts given in another unit of the respective unit
           group.
