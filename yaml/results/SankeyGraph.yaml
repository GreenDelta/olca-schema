           The index of the node that represents the quantitative
           reference of the graph. In order to create and layout
           a Sankey diagram, an LCA system is typically traversed in
           breadth-first order. When back-links of cycles in this
           traversal order are ignored, the (sub-) graph created
           by this traversal is a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
           with this root.
