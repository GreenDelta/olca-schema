  doc: A node in a [SankeyGraph]

  properties:
    - name: index
      index: 1
      type: int
      doc: >
           The (matrix) index of the node. This is used as the
           identifier of this node in the graph. For each
           linked technosphere flow in the system there can be
           only one node in the graph.

    - name: techFlow
      index: 2
      type: TechFlow
      doc: >
           The process-product or process-waste flow described
           by this node.

    - name: directResult
      index: 3
      type: double
      doc: >
           The direct contribution of the production (treatment)
           of the product (waste) flow described by this node
           to the total result of the system.

    - name: totalResult
      index: 4
      type: double
      doc: >
           The total result (upstream and direct) related to
           the production (treatment) of the product (waste)
           flow described by this node. Note that this product
           (waste) flow could be an input (output) of several
           processes in the system and all these instances
           are aggregated to a single node here. This is
           different than in the upstream contribution tree
           where these instances can be unrolled into multiple
           nodes (see [UpstreamNode]).
