        An Exchange is an input or output of a `Flow` in a `Process`. The amount
        of an exchange is given in a specific unit of a quantity
        (`FlowProperty`) of the flow. The allowed units and flow properties that
        can be used for a flow in an exchange are defined by the flow property
        information in that flow (see also the `FlowPropertyFactor` type).

      doc: >
           A default provider is a `Process` that is linked as the provider of a
           product input or the waste treatment provider of a waste output. It
           is just an optional default setting which can be also ignored when
           building product systems in openLCA. The user is always free to link
           processes in product systems ignoring these defaults (but the flows
           and flow directions have to match of course).

    - name: description
      index: 9
      type: string
      doc: A general comment about the input or output.

    - name: dqEntry
      index: 10
      type: string
      doc: >
           A data quality entry like `(1;3;2;5;1)`. The entry is a vector of
           data quality values that need to match the data quality scheme for
           flow inputs and outputs that is assigned to the `Process`. In such
           a scheme the data quality indicators have fixed positions and the
           respective values in the `dqEntry` vector map to these positions.

    - name: flow
      index: 11
      type: Ref[Flow]
      doc: The reference to the flow of the exchange.

    - name: flowProperty
      index: 12
      type: Ref[FlowProperty]
      doc: The quantity in which the amount is given.

    - name: internalId
      index: 13
      type: int
      doc: >
            The process internal ID of the exchange. This is used to identify
            exchanges unambiguously within a process (e.g. when linking
            exchanges in a product system where multiple exchanges with the
            same flow are allowed). The value should be >= 1.

    - name: isAvoidedProduct
      index: 14
      type: boolean
      doc: >
           Indicates whether this exchange is an avoided product (or waste
           flow). Note that there is a difference in the data model and the
           openLCA user interface: in the user interface avoided products (waste
           flows) are shown as outputs (inputs) but in the data model avoided
           products (waste flows) have `isInput` set to `true` (`false`). The
           reason for this is, that it is (maybe) more understandable in the
           user interface that the production (treatment) of some other product
           (waste) is avoided this way. However, openLCA links product inputs
           and waste outputs to providers. Avoided flows are linked in the same
           way but with a negative sign so that the respective upstream
           (downstream) chain is subtracted effectively from the result. This is
           why in the data model we have the `isInput` property set according to
           this linking logic.
