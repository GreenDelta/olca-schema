# openLCA Schema
This project contains the specification of the [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/)
based data exchange format of [openLCA](http://www.openlca.org/).

The different data types are defined in simple [YAML](http://yaml.org/) files
with a file for each type in the [yaml folder](./yaml). An HTML documentation
can be generated via the `scripts/yaml_to_html.py` script. The script uses
[PyYAML](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/) which you need to install before
running it (e.g. via `pip install PyYAML`).

You can also browse the [HTML documentation online](http://greendelta.github.io/olca-schema).
