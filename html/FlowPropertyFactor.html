    <h1>Class <a href="#">FlowPropertyFactor</a></h1>
    <p class="comment">A FlowPropertyFactor is a conversion factor between <a href="./FlowProperty.html">flow properties (quantities)</a> of a <a href="./Flow.html">flow</a>. As an example the amount of the flow 'water' in a process could be expressed in 'kg' mass or 'm3' volume. In this case the flow water would have two flow property factors: one for the flow property 'mass' and one for 'volume'. Each of these flow properties has a reference to a <a href="./UnitGroup.html">unit group</a> which again has a reference unit. In the example the flow property 'mass' could reference the unit group 'units of mass' with 'kg' as reference unit and volume could reference the unit group 'units of volume' with 'm3' as reference unit. The flow property factor is now the conversion factor between these two reference units where the factor of the reference flow property of the flow is 1. If the reference flow property of 'water' in the example would be 'mass' the respective flow property factor would be 1 and the factor for 'volume' would be 0.001 (as 1 kg water is 0.001 m3). The amount of water in a process can now be also given in liter, tons, grams etc. For this, the unit conversion factor of the respective unit group can be used to convert into the reference unit (which then can be used to convert to the reference unit of another flow property). Another thing to note is that different flow properties can refer to the same unit group (e.g. MJ upper calorific value and MJ lower calorific value.)
